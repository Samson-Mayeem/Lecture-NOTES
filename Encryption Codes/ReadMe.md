The time complexity of the provided SHA-256 implementation is dominated by the number of chunks in the input message and the number of rounds in the SHA-256 algorithm. Let's analyze the key components:

    Message Padding: The message is padded to a length that is a multiple of 64 bytes. The time complexity for this step is O(n), where n is the length of the original message.

    Chunk Processing: The padded message is divided into chunks of 64 bytes each. For each chunk, 64 words are processed. The time complexity for this step is O(m), where m is the number of chunks.

    Rounds: For each of the 64 words in a chunk, 64 rounds are performed. Each round involves several bitwise operations and additions. The time complexity for this step is constant as it is a fixed number of operations per round.

Therefore, the overall time complexity of the SHA-256 implementation is O(n + m), where n is the length of the original message, and m is the number of 64-byte chunks.

The space complexity is mainly determined by the size of the input message and the constants used in the algorithm. The algorithm uses a constant amount of space for variables, regardless of the input size, so the space complexity is O(1).

In summary, the time complexity is linear with respect to the message length and the number of chunks, and the space complexity is constant.
